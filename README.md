# Helmet-Detection-Using-OpenCV-and-Keras

This project aims to create a Deep Neural Network that can identify whether a person is wearing a helmet or not. This is achieved by using a Convolutional Neural Network, which is written using the Keras API of Tensorflow. Real-time Inference on a live feed is done by processing the video through OpenCV. Such a system can be very useful in detecting people who are violating traffic rules, which can further result in a decrease in the number of accidents that take place on our roads.
